Hi! I'm Neeraj Adhikari. I work as a software engineer. I love free and open-source software, care about data privacy and
dabble in self-hosting. Recently I've become more interested in type theory, formal methods, and the mathematics of
computing in general.

I was born and raised in Nepal, and I currently live in Spokane, WA.
